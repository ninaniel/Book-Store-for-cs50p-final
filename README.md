<h4 style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold;"> Welcome to the Bookstore Application! </h4>

This Python program is designed to manage a bookstore, allowing users to browse through various book collections, add books to their shopping cart, and generate invoices. The application is now built using object-oriented principles, featuring classes for books, collections, and invoices.

The application dynamically loads book data from a `collections.json` file, with support for different categories of books.

## Description and Features:

### Features:
- Browse through multiple book collections by category or century.
- View books in a paginated table format with title, author, and price.
- Add books to the shopping cart and manage quantities.
- Remove books from the cart and view updated cart details.
- Checkout, review cart, and generate a detailed PDF invoice.
- Exit the application gracefully after completing or canceling a transaction.

### Main Classes Descriptions:

#### `Book` class:
Represents a book with attributes like `index`, `title`, `author`, and `price`.

#### `Collection` class:
Stores a collection of books and supports pagination (viewing books in chunks, like pages).

#### `Invoice` class:
Manages the shopping cart by adding/removing books, displaying cart contents, and generating a PDF invoice.

#### `BookstoreApp` class:
Handles user interaction, displaying menus, navigating through books, adding books to the cart, and managing the entire book browsing and purchasing process.

### Key Features and Updates:
- **Category Selection**: Browse through books based on categories such as "Books You Must Read Before You Die", "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "History Books", and more.
- **Pagination**: Browse through books in paginated format, viewing 100 books at a time.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add and remove books, view the total price, and manage cart items with quantity.
- **Checkout**: At checkout, the program prompts for customer details (name, address) and generates a PDF invoice.
- **Invoice Generation**: Once the purchase is confirmed, a detailed invoice is generated as a PDF, displaying the books, prices, and customer details.
