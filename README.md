**Welcome to the Book Shop Application!**
 This Python program allows users to browse through various book categories, select books to purchase, and proceed to checkout. 
 
 The application uses data saved to an Excel file `books.xlsx` from [Goodreads books collections](https://www.goodreads.com/list?ref=nav_brws_lists).


## Description and Features:

### Features
- Browse through multiple book categories.
- View a list of books in each category.
- Add books to the shopping cart.
- Remove books from the shopping cart.
- View the shopping cart and total price.
- Checkout and generate an invoice PDF.

`The main function` serves as the entry point of the program. It starts by displaying a greeting message and initializing some variables. It then enters a while loop that allows users to navigate through the different categories and perform various actions such as choosing a book to buy, navigating between pages, and checking out.

**Category Selection**:  ["Books You Must Read Before You Die"](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/952.1001_Books_You_Must_Read_Before_You_Die), ["Science Fiction & Fantasy"](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/2700.Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_Must_Reads), ["History Books,"](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1362.Best_History_Books_), ["Memoir/Biography/Autobiography"](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/281.Best_Memoir_Biography_Autobiography), ["Motivational and Self-Improvement Books"](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/7616.Motivational_and_Self_Improvement_Books).

`The load_books function` loads the book data from the Excel file and returns it as a list of lists and uses the tabulate library to display the book data in a grid format.

**Browsing Books**: Within each category, users can navigate through multiple pages of books and view details such as title, author, and price(*the prices are randomly generated*).

`The buy_book function` serves to add selected book to the cart

**Shopping Cart**: Users can review the item(s) added and proceed to checkout.

`The checkout function` displays the options available to the user such as checking out, adding more books to the cart, removing undesired ones or canceling the checkout process.

**Checkout**: At checkout, users can confirm payment, enter their personal information to an invoice for their purchase.

`The create_invoice function` collects customer information, and generates an invoice PDF file.
